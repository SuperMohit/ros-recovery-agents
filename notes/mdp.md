Mathematical Definition of Multi-Agent Maintenance Robot MDP
State Space (S)
S = (L, M, Q, B, E, T, F) where:
L = {l_1, l_2, ..., l_n} : Locations of n maintenance robots
M = {m_1, m_2, ..., m_k} : Overall states of k machines, where each m_i ∈ {0, 1, 2} (0=operational, 1=needs maintenance, 2=broken)
Q = {q_1, q_2, ..., q_k} : Priority queue for maintenance tasks
B = {b_1, b_2, ..., b_n} : Battery levels of robots, where each b_i ∈ [0, 100]
E : Environmental conditions
T : Time factor
F = {F_m, F_s, F_b, F_c} : Detailed fault states where:
F_m : Motor/actuator faults (wear, instability, backlash)
F_s : Sensor faults (drift, noise, dropout)
F_b : Battery/power faults (degradation, brownout)
F_c : Communication faults (delay, packet loss)
Action Space (A)
For each robot i, the action space is: A_i = A_move ∪ A_diagnose ∪ A_repair ∪ A_charge ∪ A_communicate where:
A_move = {move_to(j) | j ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}} : Move to machine j
A_diagnose = {inspect(j), analyze_motor(j), analyze_sensor(j), analyze_power(j), analyze_comm(j) | j ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}}
A_repair = {repair_motor(j), repair_sensor(j), repair_power(j), repair_comm(j), replace_part(j) | j ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}}
A_charge = {charge()}
A_communicate = {delegate(i', j, task) | i' ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, i' ≠ i, j ∈ {1, 2, ..., k}, task ∈ repair tasks}
The joint action space is A = A_1 × A_2 × ... × A_n
Transition Function (P)
P(s'|s, a) defines the probability of transitioning to state s' from state s by taking joint action a.
For example:
Movement success probability: 1 - move_failure_prob


Repair success probability depends on fault type and robot condition:


P(repair_success|repair_motor) = 0.85 * (1 - battery_degradation * 0.3)
P(repair_sensor|repair_sensor) = 0.9 * (1 - battery_degradation * 0.3)
etc.
Fault development probabilities:


P(motor_wear_increase) = fault_development_rate * (1 + current_wear) * random_factor
P(sensor_drift_increase) = fault_development_rate * random_factor
Reward Function (R)
R_i(s, a_i, s') for robot i:
R_i(s, a_i, s') =
+120 if a_i = repair_motor(j) and successful
+100 if a_i = repair_sensor(j) and successful
+110 if a_i = repair_power(j) and successful
+90 if a_i = repair_comm(j) and successful
+150 if a_i = replace_part(j) and successful
+50 for each fault detected during analysis
+30 for inspecting a machine that needs maintenance
+10 for each early fault detection during inspection
-20 for failed repair attempt
-40 if fault escalates from minor to major
-100 if m_j = 2 (machine breakdown, shared)
-1 to -5 for movement (distance-based)
-10 if b_i < 10 (low battery)
-50 if battery depleted
-20 per power brownout
-15 per communication packet loss
-5 for failed delegation
+10 for successful delegation
The total reward is: R(s, a, s') = Σ(i=1 to n) R_i(s, a_i, s')
Discount Factor (γ)
γ = 0.95 (balances immediate vs. future rewards)
Fault Development Equations
Motor wear increase: wear_t+1 = min(1.0, wear_t + fault_development_rate * (1 + wear_t) * random_factor)


Sensor drift increase: drift_t+1 = min(1.0, drift_t + fault_development_rate * random_factor)


Battery degradation: degradation_t+1 = min(1.0, degradation_t + fault_development_rate * 0.5) if robot active


Machine state update rule: machine_state = 1 if any(fault > fault_threshold) else 0 P(breakdown) = 0.05 * sum(fault_severity) if any(fault > critical_threshold)


Battery Consumption
Movement: min(5, distance) * (1 + battery_degradation)
Inspection: 2 * (1 + battery_degradation * 0.5)
Analysis: 3 * (1 + battery_degradation * 0.5)
Repair: 8 * (1 + battery_degradation * 0.5)
Replacement: 15 * (1 + battery_degradation * 0.5)
MDP Objective
Find the optimal policy π* that maximizes the expected discounted sum of rewards: V*(s) = max_π E[Σ(t=0 to ∞) γ^t R(s_t, a_t, s_t+1) | s_0 = s, a_t = π(s_t)]
